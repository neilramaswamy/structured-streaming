We'll start our stateful stream processing "theory" by introducing time domains. But to make this theory less abstract, we'll use the example of a _billing pipeline_ in all the subsequent examples. A very common batch (and streaming) use-case is a billing pipeline, which aggregates usage logs per-customer per-day and computes some function over those logs to determine how much to charge a customer. A very simple pricing model could be $0.01 per log, and the aggregation logic would just have to count the number of records per-customer per-day, and multiply by 1 cent.

## From the Batch World

In the batch world, this actually is fairly straightforward. In pseudo-SQL, this is the following:

```
SELECT COUNT(logId) * 0.01 GROUP BY customerId, WINDOW(date, "day")
```

This code works because the `date` is assumed to be the timestamp at which the log was generated. In the streaming setting, on the other hand, the streaming engine is processing records in real-time, but those records might be delayed by the network. As a result, records in the streaming world belong to two time domains: when they were generated, and when they are processed. If we're writing a streaming job, what should we aggregate on?

Consider the following situation. A customer uses a cloud service at 11:50pm on a Tuesday, but the log that reports this usage reaches the billing streaming job 15 minutes late, at 12:05am on Wednesday. The streaming engine now has two choices:

- Since the event was _generated_ on Tuesday, should it put this record into the aggregate for Tuesday?
- Since the event was _received_ on Wednesday, should it put it into the aggregate for Wednesday?

If you were the customer, what would you want? You probably would want to see your bill reflect your _actual_ usage, and not reflect your usage after the network delayed the log events you generated. You'd want the streaming engine to aggregate based on when you used the service, not when the it received your data. We need to make sure that the streaming engine knows to do this.

## Event-Time vs. Processing-Time

In the streaming world, the two time domains have more formal names:

- _Event-time_ is the time-domain in which events are generated (e.g. by end-users)
- _Processing-time_ is the time-domain in which events are received by servers, i.e. Kafka, Kinesis, etc.

Almost always, stateful streaming operators will use _event-time_. With aggregation for example, the aggregation operator should place the record in the window corresponding to the event-time extracted from the record itself. Very shortly, we'll show you the syntax for specifying the name of a record's event-time column to Structured Streaming, but for now, you just need to remember that these two time domains exist.
