## Structured Streaming OSS Documentation

This is the private repo in which the new Structured Streaming OSS documentation will be developed.

## Developing Locally

1. Create virtual environment and enter in: `python3 -m venv env`. And then, `source ./env/bin/activate`
2. Install the dependencies: `pip install requirements.txt`
3. Run the server: `mkdocs serve`. That should give you a local URL on which you can view changes.
4. Beware: if your editor auto-formats on save, it might mess up some of the MkDocs directives. I will try to fix this shortly.
